        <h2>Super Nintendo World</h2>
        <div class="travel_gallery">
        <img src="images/super_nintendo_world_toad.gif" alt="Toad character mascot waving">
        <p>The first video games I ever played were the Super Mario games. So last summer, I decided to take a trip to the Super Nintendo World in Japan.</p>
        <img src="images/super_nintendo_world_entrance.jpeg" alt="Mario World green pipe entrance with a sign for Super Nintendo World">
        <p>If you are ever in Japan you must visit Super Nintendo World. The details make you feel like you are in Mario's world.</p>
        <img src="images/super_nintendo_world_castle.jpg" alt="Fullsize replica of Princess Peach's castle with a mushroom road leading to the entrance">
        <p>My favorite character is Princess Peach. So of course I had to visit her castle. Hopefully Bowser doesn't stop by and mess things up.</p>
        <img src="images/super_nintendo_world_bowser.jpg" alt="Sculpture of the character Bowser">
        <p>Oh no, look like Bowser couldn't stay away for long. Even though he is a villain, I did think this sculpture was pretty cool.</p>

        <h2>Centralia, Pennsylvania</h2>
        <div class="travel_gallery">
        <img src="images/centralia_fog.gif" alt="panning viewing of steam rising from the ground">
        <p>As a big fan of horror games, especially Silent Hill, I decided to stop by Centralia during my last cross country road trip. This abandoned mining town is a must see for all horror fans.</p>
        <img src="images/centralia_houses.jpg" alt="fog and dead trees surround two abandoned white houses">
        <p>I wonder what lurks in these abandoned houses... What does the fog hide?</p>
        <img src="images/centralia_road.jpg" alt="steam flows out of a deep crack in an abandoned road">
        <p>I chose to explore this town on foot. The landscape was not friendly for my car.</p>

        <h2>Norway</h2>
        <div class="travel_gallery">
        <img src="images/norway_view.gif" alt="panning view of Norway rocky coastline with houses">
        <p>Skyrim takes place in a fictional world, but many of the landscapes are based on viking and nordic culture.</p>
        <img src="images/norway_swords.jpg" alt="three large swords sculptures lit in pink light">
        <p>I think my character in Skyrim definitely had a sword like this.</p>
        <img src="images/norway_skyline.jpg" alt="A river with houses and buildings lining its coast.">
        <p>The towns are much more colorful than Skyrim's drab scenery. I will say I love the IRL towns much more.</p>
