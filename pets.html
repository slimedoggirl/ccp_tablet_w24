            <h2>Bob the Cat</h2>
            <p>Bob is my 10 year old cat. While, not named after Bob the cat she is very lazy just like the character. She loves to sleep and snuggle up with her people.</p>
            <p>Bob sadly doesn't live in Ann Arbor with me. Instead she is in Kalamazoo with my partner. Thankfully she is not too far away.</p>

            <p>Last summer my friend adopted a Shih Tzu puppy and named her Isabelle after the character from Animal Crossing. She and her brother were so cute when we went to pick her up.</p>
            <p>Isabelle is as smart as her video game counter part. She knows some tricks and loves showing off. </p>

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>
